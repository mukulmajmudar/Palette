# Palette

Palette contains some reusable snippets to work with Backbone.

1. Organize routes in classes with execute and clean-up hooks.
2. Load templates and style sheets just by declaring them in Backbone Views.
3. Get notified when your Backbone View is added to the page.
4. Loading spinner for asynchronous render operations.
5. Grid widget for items with optionally variable heights.

Depends on Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, and Mustache.

Build with r.js -o build.js
